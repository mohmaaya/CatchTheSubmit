#Catch the Submit
TechStack used: React JS, CSS
<br>
In this React App, I created a login form wherein the user can only click on the submit when the validations are accepted.
<br>
I used simple validation of having 8 characters in the username and a mix of uppercase and lowercase in password. If this satisfied the user can click on the submit otherwise the submit could not be caught.
The form is created using simply useRef and haven't used useEffect hook. Instead with the help of onChange itself the validations are checked if they satify or not.
In CSS used the flexbox for proper alignment and etc.
